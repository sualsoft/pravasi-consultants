#### Quality of Life in New Zealand

In many ways it’s not what we have that’s important to our quality of life, it’s what we don’t have! We don’t have high crime rates, our police don’t carry guns, and instances of corruption are virtually unheard of. We don’t have abject poverty or hunger and we don’t have the pollution, congestion, health issues, and cramped city living that we see elsewhere. One of the things you will find here, and it’s something we take very seriously, is our acceptance of different views and ideas. We are a modern, secular, democratic society with no ingrained class system. Freedom of speech, expression, and religious belief is guaranteed in law.

#### New Zealand Temperatures

New Zealand has a largely temperate climate. While the far north has subtropical weather during summer, and inland alpine areas of the South Island can be as cold as -10 C in winter, most of the country lies close to the coast, which means mild temperatures, moderate rainfall, and abundant sunshine. Because New Zealand lies in the Southern Hemisphere, the average temperature decreases as you travel south. The north of New Zealand is subtropical and the south temperate. The warmest months are December, January, and February, and the coldest June, July, and August. In summer, the average maximum temperature ranges between 20 – 30°C and in winter between 10 – 15°C.

#### History

Maori were the first inhabitants of New Zealand, arriving on the islands in about 1000. Maori oral history maintains that the Maoris came to the island in seven canoes from other parts of Polynesia. In 1642, New Zealand was explored by Abel Tasman, a Dutch navigator. British captain James Cook made three voyages to the islands, beginning in 1769. Britain formally annexed the islands in 1840.

The Treaty of Waitangi (Feb. 6, 1840) between the British and several Maori tribes promised to protect Maori land if the Maoris recognized British rule. Encroachment by British settlers was relentless, however, and skirmishes between the two groups intensified.
