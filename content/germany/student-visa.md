#### Study Visa

A student visa allows you to study full time in New Zealand. Students who are undertaking a course of 12 months or more are eligible to work for 20 hours per week and full time during Christmas Holidays. After graduating from a course that would qualify for points under the Skilled Migrant Category, students are eligible to apply for a Post Study Work Visa without an offer of employment. After this Post Study Work Visa it is possible to apply for an Essential Skills Work Visa (2-3 years) with an offer of employment relevant to their course/qualifications.

#### Free Study Guidance

If you want to study in New Zealand, at primary, secondary or tertiary level, you will need a study visa. We may be able to assist to lodge a student visa application in your home country or when you are in New Zealand. The same is applicable for student visa extensions.

That is when you want to continue or finish your chosen study, we can assist you to lodge an application for an extension of your current valid visa. The NZ Asia staff, which is a team of professionals working under the supervision of a Licensed Immigration Adviser Mr. Harminder Singh, are guiding and counseling the students through the entire visa process. All the student visa process, as well as guidance, is free throughout our offices including Auckland.
